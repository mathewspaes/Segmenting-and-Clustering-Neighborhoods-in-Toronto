# Segmenting-and-Clustering-Neighborhoods-in-Toronto

In this assignment, you will be required to explore, segment, and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto. However, unlike the demonstration project with the city of New York, the neighborhood data is not readily available on the internet.   

For the Toronto neighborhood data, a Wikipedia page exists that has all the information we need to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto. You will be required to scrape the Wikipedia page and wrangle the data, clean it, and then read it into a pandas dataframe so that it is in a structured format like the New York dataset.  

Once the data is in a structured format, you can replicate the analysis that we did to the New York City dataset to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto.
